Although this is not mandatory, doing so really motivates me to keep making
more awesome content.

By contributing to this project, you adhere to this project's code of conduct. They are as follows:-

- Your code must be properly formatted.
- The code you contribute you must be your own.
- Your code must be error and bug free.
- File structure must be proper. You must write the code for a particular language in that particular folder. For example, write Java code in the `Java` folder and Python code in `Python` folder, etc.
- Inside a folder, write the program in a subfolder for that particular topic. For example, write Array programs in `Array` folder, Linked List programs in `LinkedList` folder, etc.
- Make sure you exclude the auto-generated files by adding them in `.gitignore`.
- Do **not** spam.

**Note:** The maintainers of this repository may not accept your changes if
they do not meet our standards.

## How to Contribute 👨‍💻

Before contributing, make sure you have read the contribution guidelines above.
Failing to meet our standards, your contributions will not be merged.
With that out of the way, let's get our hands dirty by writing some code.

Go to the folder where you want to clone this project then do the following.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:adarshpand3y/hacktoberfest2023-DSA.git .
```

Open the folder in the code editor of your choice and make the changes. 

Stage the changes

```bash
  git add .
```

Commit the changes

```bash
  git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```
Push the changes to github

```bash
  git push
```

Once you have successfully pushed the project, open GitHub and click on
the dropdown next to **Contribute** and click on **Open pull request**.

After that, write a message and a comment (optional).
Then click on **Create pull request**.

## Tech Stack ✨

We do not limit your knowledge. Hence we accept all programming languages.
You should, however, write your code for a particular language in a that
particular folder. In case a folder does not exist for a particular language,
create one. Failing to do so will result in your pull request getting rejected.

If you are a beginner and do not know which language to get started with, C, C++,
Java or Python is recommended. These are some standard languages to start your
programming journey.

**Note:** You must add the corresponding auto-generated file in the `.gitignore` file.
